## Description

This Python project involves an econometric analysis of inflation and unemployment rates for five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, United Kingdom) for the year 2023, with projections for 2024. The project includes three main sections:
1. **Data Arrangement**: Creating and displaying data related to inflation and unemployment, and calculating the number of unemployed.
2. **Estimating the Phillips Curve**: Calculating the parameters of the Phillips model to estimate the relationship between inflation and unemployment, and determining the necessary policy efforts.
3. **Estimating the Phillips Curve (continued)**: Calculating the effects of fiscal policies for 2024 and providing specific recommendations for each country.

## Goals

The objectives of this study are:
1. **Organize and Display Data**: Present inflation and unemployment rates for each country, and calculate the number of unemployed in millions for 2023.
2. **Estimate the Phillips Curve**: Determine the parameters of the relationship between inflation and unemployment, assess the gaps between observed unemployment rates and the natural rate.
3. **Forecast for 2024**: Calculate the effects of fiscal policies on unemployment for 2024, and provide policy recommendations for each country.

## Dataset

The data used in this project include:
- **Period**: 2023 and forecasts for 2024.
- **Countries**: France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, United Kingdom.
- **Variables**:
  - **Inflation Rate** (2023 and forecasts for 2024).
  - **Unemployment Rate** (2023 and forecasts for 2024).
  - **Active Population** (in millions, for 2023 and 2024).
- **Data Source**: Inflation and unemployment rates are directly provided within the script.

## Tools

The tools and resources used for this project include:
- **Programming Language**: Python.
- **Libraries and Modules**:
  - Statistical and mathematical calculations (e.g., `math`, `numpy` for averaging and statistics).
  - File input/output management.
